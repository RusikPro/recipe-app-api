# You can clean up dangling images (and potentially solve the "none:none"
# issue) by running Docker's prune command. Be careful, as this will remove all
# unused Docker objects (images, containers, volumes, and networks).
docker system prune


# To remove dangling images specifically:
docker image prune


# Building With No Cache: To ensure that your build does not use any cached
# layers (which might help if the issue is caused by caching), you can build
# your Docker image with the --no-cache flag. Note that this will make the
# build take longer since it has to recreate every layer.
docker-compose build --no-cache
